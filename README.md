### Hi, I'm [Your Name] 👋 and I'm passionate about creating games using Unity and C#.

**Summary**: Unity C# developer since 2019, with a passion for creating various types of games. I have experience in developing multiplayer, story-driven, hyper-casual, mobile, and action games. While I recently ventured into Unreal Engine 5 and C++, I discovered that C# offers the powerfulness and simplicity I require for constructing solid code architectures in my games. My philosophy is that if someone else can do something, with enough time and effort, I can do it just as well. Therefore, I never give up on pursuing what I want.

### Experience 👨‍💻

Besides those, I have done various other games: one in Unreal 4, one using SDL2 library and C++, and five Unity games. Most of them were done in game jams. I have also worked with databases in 2 other games and GitHub in all of my games.
