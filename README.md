### Hi, I'm Luiz Felipe Bustamante üëã and I'm a game developer!


### Summary
Unity C# developer since 2019, with a passion for creating various types of games. While I recently ventured into Unreal Engine 5 and C++, I discovered that C# offers the powerfulness and simplicity I require for constructing solid code architectures in my games.
